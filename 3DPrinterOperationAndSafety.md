# 3D Printer Safety Consideration

### Hot Surfaces: 
The print head block and UV lamp generate heat. Such surfaces must be guarded and labeling 
must warn users of the hazards.

### Fire hazards: 
These apply mainly to FDM printers, and can be caused by an electrical fault or a heating-related failure. </br>
### Airborne particulates: 
Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are released during printing both by FDM and resin printing. Anyone exposed (including children or pets) can suffer from long-term health problems.
### Mechanical risks: 
These include, for example, cutting yourself when removing supports or getting your finger pinched or burned by the nozzle.
### Electrical risks: 
These may result in electrocution and overheating.
As you can already begin to see, some of these factors can be majorly mitigated, while others are intrinsic to the printerâ€™s operation and require a different approach.

### Chemical Vapors:
The heating of certain thermoplastic filaments can generate toxic vapors and vapors with high volatile organic compounds (VOCs). There are a variety of printing materials available for use with 3D printers, each with its own inherent hazards. The two most commonly used materials are Polylactic Acid (PLA) and Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS). Other printing materials used include metallic powders, which are generally used to fabricate tools and machinery parts. Please review product Safety Data Sheets (SDSs) for material-specific safety information before using anything in a 3D printer.

### Eating in 3D Printing Room:
Eating, drinking, applying cosmetics, chewing gum, or handling contact lenses in rooms that contain 3D 
printing operations must be prohibited. Users must wash their hands thoroughly after working with 3D 
printers
