# 3D Printer Safety Consideration

Generally speaking, one can categorize 3D printer safety risks into four areas:

### Fire hazards: 
These apply mainly to FDM printers, and can be caused by an electrical fault or a heating-related failure. </br>
### Airborne particulates: 
Including volatile organic compounds (VOCs), these are released during printing both by FDM and resin printing. Anyone exposed (including children or pets) can suffer from long-term health problems.
### Mechanical risks: 
These include, for example, cutting yourself when removing supports or getting your finger pinched or burned by the nozzle.
### Electrical risks: 
These may result in electrocution and overheating.
As you can already begin to see, some of these factors can be majorly mitigated, while others are intrinsic to the printer’s operation and require a different approach.

Before we dive into problems and solutions specific to FDM and resin printing, let’s take an overview of what applies to both.
